• TRIPLE RINSE THE EMPTY CONTAINER AS FOLLOWS: Invert the empty container over the spray or
mixing tank and drain. Thereafter rinse the empty container three (3) times in succession with one quarter
of the container volume fresh water and decant the rinsate into the spray or mixing tank. Puncture the triple
rinsed container and dispose of via an approved collector or recycler (www.croplife.co.za). Do not bury,
burn or donate the container to any other parties that may use it as a container for food or beverages.
• Do not apply gel to areas which have been recently sprayed with insecticides and avoid spraying insecticide
over gel as it may cause the bait to become repellent.
• When empty, dispose of the cartridges safely. Empty cartridges may not be discarded in normal domestic
trash, if this option is followed ensure that the cartridge is damage in such a way that it cannot be re-filled
or re-used.
• Do not attempt to open or re-fill the cartridge.
• Do not re-use the cartridge for any other purpose.
FIRST AID TREATMENT
• General advice: Remove the victim from the area of exposure. Wash off remaining material with plenty of water.
In the event of any complaints or symptoms, avoid further exposure. Get medical help if you feel unwell.
• Inhalation: Remove person from contaminated area to fresh air and assist breathing as needed. Seek
medical attention if irritation occurs.
• Skin: Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Gently wipe off excess chemical. Wash skin gently and
thoroughly with water and non-abrasive soap. Obtain medical attention.
• Eyes: Flush eyes with clean water for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Lift eyelids to facilitate irrigation. If present,
remove contact lenses after 5 minutes and continue rinsing. Seek medical attention.
• Ingestion: Seek medical attention or call a poison control centre for treatment advice. Do not induce
vomiting unless instructed to do so by a poison control centre or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to
an unconscious person. If the person is alert, rinse mouth thoroughly with water.
• Advice to physician: Treat symptomatically and supportively. No specific antidote known.
RESISTANCE WARNING
ABALEX INSECT GEL contains active ingredients belonging to IRAC group codes 6 and 7C. Any insect
population may contain individuals naturally resistant to ABALEX INSECT GEL and other group codes 6 and
7C insecticides. The resistant individuals can eventually dominate the insect population if these insecticides
are used repeatedly. These resistant insects may not be controlled by ABALEX INSECT GEL or any other
insecticide with IRAC group codes 6 or 7C.
To delay insecticide resistance:
• avoid exclusive repeated use of insecticides from the same insecticide group code. Alternate with
products from different insecticide group codes,
• integrate other control methods (chemical, cultural, biological) into pest control programmes.
For specific information on resistance management contact the registration holder of this product.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Only use as directed.
Product information:
• Application rate is dependent on the level of infestation and species to be controlled. It is effective against
the nymphs and adults of the American cockroach, Periplanata americana, and the German cockroach,
Blatella germanica.
• ABALEX INSECT GEL is also very attractive to House crickets.
• Avoid placing gel on fabrics or carpets since it may stain some absorbent materials. Test fabrics for staining
by placing a small droplet in an inconspicuous area.

• To prevent staining, exposed bait should be cleaned up immediately with a damp cloth or sponge.
General information:
Use ABALEX INSECT GEL as a spot or crack and crevice treatment for the control of German and American
cockroaches in:
• Residential, including kitchens, places where food is prepared, processed, and stored such as restaurants
and food manufacturers, warehouses and shops, public buildings e.g., schools, hospitals, hotels, prisons,
churches, theatres etc.
• Industrial premises e.g., factories, warehouses, shops, workshops, aircraft, vehicles, railways, and ships.
• Non-food areas such as garbage rooms, lavatories, floor drains (the sewers), entries, and vestibules,
offices, locker rooms, machine rooms, boiler rooms etc.
USE RESTRICTIONS
Applications in food/feed handling areas:
• Do not apply bait to areas where food utensils or food preparations surfaces may become contaminated.
• Do not apply bait in cracks and crevices of areas that are routinely washed, tops of tables, food/feed
preparation and prepared food/feed holding surfaces as the bait may be removed by washing.
• Care should be taken to avoid depositing gel onto exposed surfaces. If the gel gets into contact with an
exposed surface, remove it and wash the exposed surface.
• Food/feed areas include areas for receiving, storage, packing (canning, bottling, wrapping, boxing),
preparing edible waste for storage, and enclosed processing systems (mills, dairies, edible oils, syrups).
Serving areas are also considered a food area when food is exposed, and facility is in operation.
Applications to control Crickets:
• Product is meant to be used indoors against the House cricket, Acheta domesticus. For this use pattern
all applications are indoors.
General instructions:
1. CONTROL OF COCKROACHES
   • Survey the area to be treated to identify centres of Cockroach infestation; by means of inspection or
   trapping with sticky traps. Cockroaches typically prefer areas that are dark, warm, humid, and
   undisturbed (such as behind refrigerators and in electrical equipment). Also look out for empty egg
   cases, Cockroach faeces and cast skins.
   • ABALEX INSECT GEL is very attractive to Cockroaches and feeding begins soon after placement of
   the gel. It is effective against the nymphs and adults of the American cockroach, Periplanata americana,
   and the German cockroach, Blatella germanica.
   • Cockroaches are coprophagous, which means they eat their own faeces and the faeces of other
   Cockroaches. They are also cannibalistic, which means they feed on each other. After consuming a
   lethal dose of bait, Cockroaches return to the harbourage where they excrete faeces containing the
   actives, Abamectin and Pyriproxyfen. As other Cockroaches consume the contaminated faeces, they
   too receive a lethal dose. When the Roaches die, other Roaches may consume their carcasses and die
   as well.
   • ABALEX INSECT GEL also reduces the population by preventing reproduction and insect maturation.
   • Best control is achieved when ABALEX INSECT GEL is placed within or close to areas where
   Cockroaches feed and breed. Clean the area to be treated before treatment and remove alternative
   food sources.
   • Apply ABALEX INSECT GEL as small spots throughout the target area in dark out-of-sight locations in
   cracks, crevices, behind cupboards and shelves, under kitchen appliances, in electrical control boxes,
   voids and ducting and under bathroom fixtures etc. Also specifically look for warm, moist areas. Around
   and under dishwashers, refrigerators, ice machines, sinks tubs and toilets and around drain openings
   which are particularly attractive areas for cockroaches.
   • However, for improved residual control, do not apply ABALEX INSECT GEL where it will become wet,
   submersed, or removed by regular cleaning.
   • Other insecticides must not be applied on or around ABALEX INSECT GEL spots, or the spots placed
   on recently treated surfaces. The ABALEX INSECT GEL will be contaminated, and Cockroaches may
   be discouraged to feed on it.

2. CONTROL OF CRICKETS
   • ABALEX INSECT GEL contains the active ingredients Abamectin and Pyriproxyfen in a formulation
   that is highly attractive to House crickets, adults, and nymphs.
   • Indoors:
- ABALEX INSECT GEL may be used to control Acheta domesticus in crawl spaces, basements,
  attics of residential, industrial, and commercial buildings and structures.
- This type of application is not intended to provide complete control of an indoor Cricket infestation.
  NOTE
  THE APPLICATION OF SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT GEL SPOTS ARE BETTER THAN OCCASIONAL
  LARGE SPOTS.
